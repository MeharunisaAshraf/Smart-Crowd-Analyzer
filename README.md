# Smart-Crowd-Analyzer
Final Year Project based on Machine Learning Algorithms

[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/ggC7FZuL7wk)

**Problem Statement:**
Over the last decade, retailers are facing significant obstacles, such a staff planning, unavailability
of stocks, accumulation of unwanted items, and the inability to accurately forecast demands,
etc. It has been known, that without adequate preparation and strategy, the attempt to capture
more of the market is useless.This problem is targeting many major manufacturing companies,
store managers (supermarket and shopping malls), retailers, shipping companies, transportation
offices, hospitals, and medical care facilities, etc.

**Project Proposal:**
Thus we propose a system which is modeled upon a people counter, namely, ”Smart Crowd
Analyzer”. The project is based on prior research with the addition of embedded features such as
group detection, age estimation, gender determination, and regular customer detection. After
analysis of the physical traits, an analytical report is generated, that provides retailers with deep
insights analysis and tracking in retail operations, and comprehends efficient marketing schemes
that optimize their sales, and business performance.

**Project Objectives:**
The goal of this project is to use open-Frameworks C++ application on the Raspberry Pi to
handle the camera input, image abstraction, tracking, and people counting. Some of the features
of the project are as mentioned below:
• Detect the gender of people visiting.
• Detect the age of people with respect to classified age groups.
• Detect the regular customers, for bridging the gap between retailers and customers. Also
generating some discounts or priority for them.
• Detect groups of people visiting a shop. Hence, will be able to comprehend the days/ the
month, when families or groups mostly visit a shop/retail.
• Generate real time stats and analysis report that will be projected in a website.

**Benefits:**
Through this project we gain deep insights into our retail operations, and help in producing
marketing initiatives and develop a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and interaction
within our stores or in shopping malls and public environments. This will help in
increases sales and create mass production, hence, the business will flourish. This project will
also aid our investors in tracking their business especially when they have a chain store.
Our service includes:
• Stock Management
• Sales Conversion
• Visual Surveillance
• Customer Behavioral Analysis
• Staff Schedule Planner
• Public Space Designing
• Retail Analysis Report

We have classified the features into two main categories:
1. People Counting Algorithm:
comprising of two algorithms; Bi-directional Counter and Group detection.
2. Facial Algorithm:
comprising of Age & Gender Detection, Regular Customer Detection and Staff Exclusion.
